# Word Game

In this project, I've recreate a popular online word game, Wordle:

In Wordle, users have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. You're helped along the way by ruling out letters that aren't in the word, and being told whether the correct letters are in the correct location or not.

## Getting Started

This project is created with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a modern JS build tool. It's intended to be run locally, on your computer, using Node.js and NPM.
